# Simple Udemy Design Layout

This is a small and fun web development project I learned doing in my free time on designing the Udemy homepage
Hello fellow Githubers! I have been learning the basics of Web Development and this is what I have come up with so far!

I have created a clone of the Udemy home page. It uses technologies like HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and can be done within a day with prior knowledge of these technologies. 


For starters, Udemy is an online educative platform where many talented lecturers from various domains and fields come together to put great courses for all niches, all at a subsidiary price. The design felt catchy and attractive to me, so I went on to building it. It might not be the best, but it's the start of something interesting!
